# TOP-landing-page
This landing page is a culminating project for the css lesson of The Odin Project's foundation course. It is only a static webpage created to apply and showcase what I learned so far, which are:

* Writing proper HTML structure and divisions with readable class names and incorporating Google Fonts API stylesheet link to use other font style.
* Utilizing flexbox rules to customize and organize page layout.
* Practice git workflow commands to stage, commit, and push changes to remote repository.

For presentation purposes, the page assumes an online public database and sharing platform for digital materials called "Akashic Records". The images used in this page came from https://www.pexels.com/ and https://www.svgrepo.com/.
